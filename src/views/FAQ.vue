                To get started with RTByte, simply click the
                <b>Add RTByte</b> button in the upper right corner of this page.
                Once RTByte has been invited to your server, it will
                automatically set up the following items.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="content-text">An administrator role</li>

              </ul>
              <p class="content-text">
                The server owner will be granted the Administrator role
                automatically. All of these things can be reconfigured using the

                command.

              <p class="content-text">
                Yes you can! Make sure you've reconfigured the bot to use your

              <h2 class="question">How do I use the configuration command?</h2>
              <p class="content-text">
                While the <code class="code-inline">conf</code> command looks
                complicated at first, it's actually pretty easy to use. Every
                configuration is stored as a
                <span class="highlighted">key</span>, and that key has a
                <span class="highlighted">value</span>. Keys can also be stored
                in folders, and those folders can have subfolders.
              </p>
              <p class="content-text">
                To view the configuration, you can run the following command.
              </p>
              <pre><code>-conf show</code></pre>
              <p class="content-text">
                This will show you the root folder of the configuration. You'll
                see a list of folders, as well as a couple of keys. To view one
                of those folders, simply type in the folder name. To view a
                subfolder of a folder, simply type in the folder name, followed
                by <code class="code-inline">.subfolder</code>
              </p>
              <pre><code>-conf show channels</code><br/><code>-conf show logs.events</code></pre>
              <p class="content-text">
                Setting a value for a configuration key follows the same
                structure of viewing the configuration, but is slightly
                different.
              </p>
              <pre><code>-conf set logs.events.channelUpdate <span class="highlighted">true</span></code><br/><code>           <b>游맷</b>     <b>游맷</b>           <b>游맷</b>        <b>游맷</b></code><br/><code>       folder  subfolder   key     value</code></pre>
              <p class="content-text">
                In this example, we're first telling the command that we want to
                <i>set</i> a configuration instead of showing one. After that,
                we're defining the folder (and optionally any subfolders), then
                the actual key itself. The key, much like a folder, is accessed
                by typing its name. If it's in a folder, you'd need to add
                <code class="code-inline">.key</code> after the folder name. If
                the key isn't in a folder, you can simply type in the name of
                the key.

              <h2 class="question">
                Why are configuration options named the way they are?
              </h2>
              <p class="content-text">
                The configuration keys are named the way they are due to our
                coding guidelines. The same way you access a configuration key
                when running the <code class="code-inline">conf</code> command,
                we do in the code. We're currently working on a server dashboard
                for this website, which will let you configure all your server
                settings via your browser (with the command as a backup).
              </p>
              <p class="content-text">
                We try to name the configuration options as clearly as possible,
                but in some cases it doesn't come across as clearly as we
                intended.
